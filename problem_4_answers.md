1. This line creates a domain that extends across the range of numbers present
in the first column (number of states).

2. Each call to color returns a hexadecimal RGB color code. The first call
to color(0) returns the code #ff4500 which encodes for an orange color. The second
call to color(10) returns the code #f25e26 which encodes for a less reddish
orange color. The third call to color(150) returns the code #42ffff which 
encodes for a light blue color.

3. The scale would change from one that color-coded for position, to one that
color-coded for level of unemployment rate. This would be appropriate for 
situations where the data is shifting or changing place, but it is important
to still be able to tell the relative weakness or strength of the unemployment
rate in comparison to other states (for example, on this chart, where the data
is constantly shifting places!)
